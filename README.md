# Tiny Dataset Codebook##

#source#
The source of the data was from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", obtained from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

#Script Description#
The cleaned dataset ("tidy.txt") was created by the R script, "run_analysis.R", which merges the test and training sets, renames and deletes columns, and creates the output file "tidy.txt" to give mean and standard deviation variables.

The given test and training sets were merged and given activity labels. The activity labels were translated from existing column identifiers to mak ethem more human-readable. THe mean and standard deviation variables for each subject/activity pair resulted in the final table. 

#Cleaned dataset#
The final, cleaned data set an be found in the table, "tidy.txt". A detailed description of the variables can be found in CodeBook.md.
